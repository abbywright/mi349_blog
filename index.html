      <h3>GeoGuessr Country Streaks</h3>

      <p>GeoGuessr is an engaging game that allows you to explore the world right where you are. It utilizes Google Maps to generate a variety of locations for both random and organized gameplay. Players can choose from different types of gameplay, such as Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Party and Quiz. I have specifically chosen to showcase <b>Singleplayer</b> because that&apos;s where I spend most of my time on the website. Within Singleplayer, there are several sub-categories to choose from, such as Quick Play, Classic Maps, Maprunner, Streaks, Explorer Mode, and the Daily Challenge.</p>
      <p>I wanted to highlight a specific game within Singleplayer that uses these settings, called Country Streaks. In this game, the objective is to beat any previous scores by guessing your location based on entire countries rather than submitting a specific pinpointed location. They also offer US State Streaks on the same page.</p>
      <p>In certain GeoGuessr games, basic settings about the accessibility and difficulty of each round can be changed manually before starting a new game, as shown in the image below. These settings include:
         <ul>
            <li>Default settings: 2 minute time limit, moving allowed</li>
            <li>Round time: 10 seconds to 10 minutes or no time limit</li>
            <li>Move (forward or backward): on or off</li>
            <li>Pan (left or right): on or off</li>
            <li>Zoom (in or out): on or off</li>
         </ul>

      </div>
      <p>For beginners interested in GeoGuessr, I recommend starting with Singleplayer, particularly Classic Maps and Explorer Mode. These offer a self-directed experience, allowing you to explore the world at your own pace. For more experienced players, I suggest trying Streaks, Quick Play, and Maprunner within Singleplayer. Additionally, multiplayer challenges and duels in Battle Royale are available for public competitive gameplay. Whether you prefer solo or multiplayer gameplay, GeoGuessr offers amazing kinds of gaming experiences that will challenge and improve your world knowledge forever.</p>

      <h3>5 Seconds of Summer</h3>
      <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://linkedin.com/in/abby-wright22">Abby Wright</a></address>

      <p>5 Seconds of Summer, also known as 5SOS, is an Australian pop-rock band that was formed in 2011. The group consists of members Luke Hemmings, Calum Hood, Ashton Irwin, and Michael Clifford. Throughout their music career, they have released 5 albums and have performed on 16 different tours.</p>
      <p>I have been a fan of 5 Seconds of Summer since their first self-titled album, &quot;5 Seconds of Summer&quot;, which was released in 2014. I discovered them initially through One Direction, and they soon became iconic after touring together on the Take Me Home and Where We Are tours. I have been lucky enough to see 5SOS live 3 times, with each experience better than the previous. I attended the Sounds Live Feels Live tour in 2016 after their new album release, &quot;Sounds Good Feels Good&quot;. I saw them live again in 2019, although they were not the headliners. Finally, I had the opportunity to see them again this past August, and it was one of the best concerts I have ever attended.</p>

      <p>I also wanted to share my personal rankings for all of 5SOS&apos;s albums, along with my favorite 2 songs from each album. In my opinion, 5SOS5 is their best album to date, but their other albums are also great. For anyone interested in checking out their music, checking out the songs listed in the table below is a great place to start before choosing an album to start with.</p>
