      <h2>About the Blogs</h2>
      <p id="about1">With this page, I aim to highlight my interests and hobbies from around the world. The two currently showcased, GeoGuessr and 5 Seconds of Summer, are just the beginning.</p>
      <p id="about2">I am an avid GeoGuessr fan, having played it regularly for about 2 years now. Although GeoGuessr can be challenging, it is an engaging game that I really enjoy studying and learning more about. GeoGuessr allows me to discover the entire world right where I am, making it a great tool for expanding my geographical knowledge.</p>
      <p id="about3">I have been a fan of 5 Seconds of Summer for around 10 years now, and they hold great significance in my life. They have consistently been among my top 3 most listened to artists each year since 2016, and I believe their music is timeless, well-crafted, captivating, and definitely worth exploring.</p>
